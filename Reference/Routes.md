route is a method which configures the endpoints of your application, and you can declare a route with either a shorthand or full declaration. A full declaration would be in the form fastify.route(options), while shorthand declarations will instead have an HTTP command, or all, after fastify, and be structured a little differenty. Some examples of shorhand declarations would look like these: fastify.get(path, [options], handler), fastify.head(path, [options], handler), fastify.post(path, [options], handler), fastify.put(path, [options], handler), fastify.delete(path, [options], handler), fastify.options(path, [options], handler), fastify.patch(path, [options], handler), and fastify.all(path, [options], handler).
